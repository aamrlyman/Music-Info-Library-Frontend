# Video Libarary 
This is the frontend for my fist ever full stack application. This app:
‚ùñ Displays song information for users in with a intuitive interface
‚ùñ Connects users to full CRUD functionality for all songs created
‚ùñ Features a search bar and filtering options based any song criteria including "likes"

## Development
The scaffolding was generated using React.js and connection to the backend was achieved using the Axios library. 

## CI/CD
I am using github workflows to push changes to the `main` branch as needed. 

## Project Status
This project is feature complete.

Thanks taking the time to check out my project üòä.
